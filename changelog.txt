update: 1.0.1

bugfix: 
com.nullpointerworks.util.FileUtil
- Removed a bad instruction in getSourceCodePath(Class<?>). Now correctly provides the source file path.
- Fixed the swapExtension() method which didn't swap, but instead just added the new extension.

com.nullpointerworks.util.file.Settings
- Added a newline character to save settings in the proper format. 
- Fixed setHeader() method. Now correctly adds new headers to the default list even though unknown headers are ignored by default.

com.nullpointerworks.util.file.bytefile.ByteFile
- Added methods for adding short, int and long data types instead of just bytes.
